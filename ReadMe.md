# Full Stack Authentication Project

Hi There **Neo Qasim** ðŸ‘‹ welcome to an exciting hands-on project where I Have created the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and had my our hands dirty with authentication using JSON I haveokens (JWT). This is the one of the toughest project for me as a beginner so don't worry if it seems like a lot â€“ I am here to learn together!

## What I Built

-   **Tech Stack:**
-   MongoDB
-   Express
-   React
-   Node.js
-   Redux Toolkit for State Management
-   **Authentication Journey:** I have used JWTs, and guess what? I have storing them in HTTP-only cookies for extra security against some techie thing called cross-site scripting attacks.

## Project Adventure Highlights

1. **Backend Tech fetures I have craeted :**

    - I have create some magical API routes for things like user registration, login, logout, and managing profiles.
    - , and stored tokens securely using HTTP-only cookies â€“ because security is cool!

2. **Frontend Quest:**
    - Build a snazzy user interface with the help of the React Bootstrap Library as My main focus was on Backend.
    - if you dont find the frontend folder here
